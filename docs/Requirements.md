## Critical: ##
* Usable without signing in
* When flash cards are presented, the user is in a session. The session can be canceled at any time.
* User can choose whether the session is a quiz or not.
* Must have limited number of flash cards presented per session by default which can be changed by the user.
* Words should be able to be selected as verbs, nouns etc. Selecting multiple categories should be possible.
* Users who create accounts must have a profile page. This should show created sets and some basic statistics at a minimum.
* At least one flash card onscreen at a time.
* Each flash card must have the gender of the word as well as type (e.g. adjective). Article should be included if it's a noun.
* Synonyms of a word should also be included on the card if selected as an option by the user. Same for antonyms.
* Can create own groups of words organized by verbs, nouns etc. Can also be sorted and filtered. Groups of words can also be contained within the user's 
profile.
* Groups of words can be named, include a description and have their creation and update dates recorded.
* The only difference between a registered user and unregistered user is that the registered user has access to statistics, custom card sets and 
possibly saved custom quizzes. Customizing quizzes will always be available to both types of users.

## 'Nice-to-have': ##
* Each session can be started as a quiz: user types in the word and shown to be correct or not. This option can be available to any user. However, only signed in users can have statistics on quizzes.
* Multiple flash cards onscreen at a time in a grid. Customizable by the user.
* Light and dark mode.
* Groups of words created by the user can also be featured on the user's "front page". These featured words can be selected by the user or by 
most frequently viewed. Can also be organized by favorited words.
* Words that already appear in a group should be marked with something that signifies that it already exists in another group. Whether this signifier 
leads to a link to a list of the other groups it already exists in is questionable.
* Perhaps each word can have an image associated with it or possibly a sound.

## Constraints: ##
* Unlimited (entire list of words in the API) words per session cannot be an option. There should be a maximum number of words.
* Maximum number of flash card sets per user.
* Maximum number of words per flash card set.
